### Create a Simple Queue Service at AWS
- You can choose type of the queue as per your requirements, I've used the **FIFO** type.
- Create an IAM user giving the full access to the SQS service
- Generate the credentials for that IAM user

### ENV
- Clone the **.env.example** file and name it **.env**
- Replace the env values with your values
